1. What was the bug?
   </br>
   The inputs are strings, so num1 + num2 concatenates (e.g. "4" + "5" â†’ "45") instead of summing.
2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.

   - coerce the inputs to numbers before adding
